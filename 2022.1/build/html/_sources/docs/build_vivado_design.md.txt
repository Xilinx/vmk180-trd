Using Vivado to Build the Hardware Design
================================================

### Introduction
 
This tutorial shows how to build the hardware design for applications running on VMK180 Evaluation Kit.

### Prerequisites

* Vivado Design Suite 2022.1

#### Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files

>**Note**: Skip the following steps if the design files have already been cloned and extracted to a working repository

1. To access the reference files, type the following into a terminal:

 ```
git clone --branch 2022.1 --recursive https://github.com/Xilinx/vmk180-trd.git

```
 
 Navigate to the `vmk180-trd` which is the working directory.

### Generating an Extensible XSA

1. Go to the platform directory specific to the application

   ```
   cd $working_dir/platforms/vivado/<platform_name>
   ```

   Applications and their corresponding platform names are listed in the table below

   |Application |Platform name|
   |----|----|
   |VMK180 (Multimedia-PCIe) TRD |vmk180_trd|


2. To build the XSA, Source Vivado and run the following command. The Makefile uses scripts/main.tcl file to create a Vivado project, populate the block design and finally build a XSA. The XSA generation may take couple of hours depending on the system specification

   ```
   make xsa
   ```

3. The generated XSA will be located at:

   ```
   $working_dir/platforms/vivado/<platform_name>/project/<platform_name>.xsa
   ```


>**Note**: The steps under *Modifying the Vivado design and creating a new XSA* are optional and are required only if you need to change the platform design. 


### Modifying the Vivado design and creating a new XSA

1. Go to the directory specific to the platform design

   ```
   cd $working_dir/platforms/vivado/<platform_name>
   ```

2. To open the Vivado project, first open the Vivado GUI, then run the following command from the Vivado tcl console:

   ```
   open_project ./project/<platform_name>.xpr
   ```

3. In the Flow Navigator pane on the left-hand side under IP integrator, click on Open Block Design. An IP integrator block design becomes visible that contains the Processing System (PS) IP and other PL IPs.

4. To view the Platform interfaces that are enabled for the Vitis compiler to stitch in accelerators, on the tool bar at the top click on Window > Platform Setup. Platform interfaces that are enabled are

* Clocks: To drive clock inputs on the accelerator.
* Master AXI: AXI memory-mapped master ports on the Interconnect IP to drive the accelerator's control port.
* Slave AXI: AXI memory-mapped slave ports driven by the accelerator's read/write data ports.


5. You can now modify the block design and validate it (tool bar at the top: Tools → Validate design). Then, click on Run Synthesis to complete synthesis

6. To write out a new extensible platform XSA file, run the following command from the Vivado tcl console:

   ```
   write_hw_platform -force -hw -file <platform_name>.xsa
   ```


The generated XSA or the modified XSA file can now be used to create a Vitis Platform

### Next Steps

* [Creating a Vitis Platform](build_vitis_platform.md)
* Go back to the [VMK180 Targeted Reference Designs start page](../index.html)
