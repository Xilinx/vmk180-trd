    "This notebook demonstrates how to capture video from a MIPI device, processes it through filter(optional) and display the output on a monitor using a DRM/KMS display device. This notebook uses the GStreamer multimedia framework. In addition, the memory bandwidth is measured and plotted in a parallel notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The display device uses the Xilinx DRM/KMS driver. A video mixer supports alpha blending of multiple layers (also called planes). \n",
    "The plane formats are fixed and configured as follows:\n",
    "* 4 BG24 planes (IDs: 34-37)\n",
    "* 4 YUY2 planes (IDs: 38-41)\n",
    "* 1 ARGB plane (ID: 42) - this is the primary plane used for setting the CRTC resolution\n",

    "* The ``xlnxvideosrc`` element is used to capture video from a V4L2 device\n",
    "* The ``sdxfilter2d`` element is used to implement a 2D convolution filter\n",
    "* The ``perf`` element is used to measure and print the frame rate\n",
    "* The ``kmssink`` element is used to display video on a monitor using the DRM/KMS kernel subsystem\n",

    "1. Create a GStreamer video pipeline that captures video from a V4L2 device and displays the video on a monitor using DRM/KMS.\n",
    "2. Gstreamer pipeline with and without filter is created using the configuration parameter.\n",
    "3. Run the ``trd-apm`` notebook to measure and plot the memory bandwidth while the video pipeline is running.\n",
