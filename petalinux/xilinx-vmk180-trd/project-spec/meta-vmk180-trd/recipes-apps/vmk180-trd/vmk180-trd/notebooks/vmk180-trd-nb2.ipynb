    "This notebook demonstrates how to capture video from a MIPI device, processes it through 2D convolution filter accelerator  and display the output on a monitor using a DRM/KMS display device. This notebook uses the GStreamer multimedia framework. In addition, the memory bandwidth is measured and plotted in a parallel notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The display device uses the Xilinx DRM/KMS driver. A video mixer supports alpha blending of multiple layers (also called planes). \n",
    "The plane formats are fixed and configured as follows:\n",
    "* 4 BG24 planes (IDs: 34-37)\n",
    "* 4 YUY2 planes (IDs: 38-41)\n",
    "* 1 ARGB plane (ID: 42) - this is the primary plane used for setting the CRTC resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The video mixer is connected to an HDMI encoder which drives the display. Both video mixer and HDMI encoder are implemented inside the FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D filter has a fixed kernel size of 3x3. It operates on the luma channel of a YUY2 image; The PL 2D filter performs the chroma loopback inside the kernel itself. In addition, the PL version has run-time programmable kernel coefficients and presets as well as well image dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the 2D convolution filter operation, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The various 2D filter accelerators are integrated into Gstreamer using the Vitis Video Analytics SDK (VVAS) which provides a set of plugins and an abstraction layer on top of the Xilinx run-time (XRT). For more information, see here: https://xilinx.github.io/VVAS/.\n",
    "\n",
    "2D filter is implemented in the PL using the Vitis Vision libraries and high-level synthesis (HLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The video pipeline is composed of the following GStreamer elements:\n",
    "* The ``xlnxvideosrc`` element is used to capture video from a V4L2 device\n",
    "* The ``vvas_xfilter`` element is used to implement a 2D convolution filter\n",
    "* The ``perf`` element is used to measure and print the frame rate\n",
    "* The ``kmssink`` element is used to display video on a monitor using the DRM/KMS kernel subsystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``vmk180-trd-apm`` notebook is executed in parallel to this notebook to measure and plot the memory bandwidth of the live video pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Create a GStreamer video pipeline that captures video from a V4L2 device and displays the video on a monitor using DRM/KMS.\n",
    "2. The vvas_xfilter element is used to wrap the 2D convolution filter accelerator library (Optional)\n",
    "3. Gstreamer pipeline with and without filter is created using the configuration parameter.\n",
    "4. Run the ``trd-apm`` notebook to measure and plot the memory bandwidth while the video pipeline is running.\n",
    "5. Create a GStreamer pipeline graph and view it inside this notebook.\n"
